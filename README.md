# Feed Kit
Xojo code for parsing and generating JSON feeds. See https://jsonfeed.org/ for more details.

This project is compatible with all Xojo project types.

## Status

This project is brand new. It appears to parse JSON feeds fine, but does not have code to generate them yet. May also parse RSS feeds in the future. No documentation or example yet. Best place to start is FeedKit.Parse.
